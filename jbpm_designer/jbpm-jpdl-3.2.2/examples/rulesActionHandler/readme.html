<h1>rulesActionHandler</h1>


<p>This example shows how to invoke JBoss Rules from an ActionHandler.</p>

<p>To create this example in Eclipse, you should first have created a project for jbpm.3 in your workspace. You should also have installed the latest version of the JBoss Rules IDE plugin, e.g., jbossrules-ide-3.0.5-bin. Next, use the New -> Other New Rule Project and uncheck Use Default Location and browse to the jbpm-jpdl-{version}/examples/rulesActionHandler directory and give it the project name rulesActionHandler. Go to the rulesActionHandler project Build Path Source tab add folders rulesActionHandler/src/config, rulesActionHandler/src/jpdl and rulesActionHandler/src/test. Use the Projects Tab to add jbpm.3. This should result in a clean compilation (no errors). If the shipping.drl file stills show compilation errors, do a Project -> Clean.</p>


<p>This example consists of the following files:</p>

<ul>src/java/../RulesActionHandler.java - creats the RuleBase using the Shipper.drl file, gets the Customer and Order objects from the contextInstance and asserts them into working memory, sets the contextInstance as a global, and fires the rules.</ul>

<ul>src/java/../Customer.java - simple Customer object.</ul>

<ul>src/java/../Order.java - simple Order object.</ul>

<ul>src/test/../RulesActionTest.java - JUnit test case for rulesActionHandler example.</ul>

<ul>src/rules/Shipper.drl - JBoss Rules rule file.</ul>

<ul>src/jpdl/RulesAction/processdefinition.xml - defines the processDefinition. See the Action configuration on the Ship Product node.</ul>


<p>To run the example, run the RulesActionTest.java as a JUnit test.</p>
