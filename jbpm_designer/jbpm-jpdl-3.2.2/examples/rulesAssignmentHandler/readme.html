<h1>rulesAssignmentHandler</h1>


<p>This example shows how to invoke JBoss Rules from an AssignmentHandler.</p>

<p>To create this example in Eclipse, you should first have created a project for jbpm.3 in your workspace. You should also have installed the latest version of the JBoss Rules IDE plugin, e.g., jbossrules-ide-3.0.5-bin. Next, use the New -> Other New Rule Project and uncheck Use Default Location and browse to the jbpm-jpdl-{version}/examples/rulesAssignmentHandler directory and give it the project name rulesAssignmentHandler. Go to the ruleFlow project Build Path Source tab add folders rulesAssignmentHandler/src/config, rulesAssignmentHandler/src/identity, rulesAssignmentHandler/src/jpdl and rulesAssignmentHandler/src/test. Use the Projects Tab to add jbpm.3. Use the Libraries tab and add hibernat3.jar from jbpm.3 lib directory. This should result in a clean compilation (no errors). If the assignment.drl file stills show compilation errors, do a Project -> Clean.</p>

<p>This example consists of the following files:</p>

<ul>src/main/java/RulesAssignmentHandler.java - creats the RuleBase using the Assignment.drl file, gets the Order object from the contextInstance and asserts it into working memory, sets the assignable (taskInstance) as a global, and fires the rules.</ul>

<ul>src/java/../Order.java - simple Order object.</ul>

<ul>src/java/../Role.java - simple Role object.</ul>

<ul>src/test/../RulesAssignmentTest.java - JUnit test case for rulesAssignmentHandler example.</ul>

<ul>src/rules/Assignment.drl - JBoss Rules rule file.</ul>

<ul>src/jpdl/RulesAssignment/processdefinition.xml - defines the processDefinition. See the Assignment configuration on the Approve Order node.</ul>


<p>To run the example, run the RulesAssignmentTest.java as a JUnit test.</p>
